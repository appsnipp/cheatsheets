## Clean Code by Robert C. Martin - Summary / Quick Reference

"Clean Code" by Robert C. Martin is a foundational book on writing high-quality, maintainable software. The core idea is that clean code is code that is easy to read, understand, and enhance by anyone on the team, not just the original author. It emphasizes simplicity, clarity, and minimalism in code structure.

### Key takeaways include:

- **Meaningful Names:** Use clear, descriptive names for variables, functions, classes, and modules that reveal intent.
- **Functions:** Should do one thing, do it well, and be short enough to fit on a screen. Avoid side effects and limit the number of arguments.
- **Single Responsibility Principle:** Each class or function should have a single purpose or reason to change.
- **Code Flow and Structure:** Code should flow naturally, with consistent abstraction levels and proper organization.
- **Avoid Duplication (DRY Principle):** Repetitive code increases complexity and bugs.
- **Minimal Comments:** Clean code is self-explanatory; comments should only explain why something unusual is done, not what the code does.
- **Testing:** Code must pass all tests for stability and confidence in changes.
- **Refactoring:** Always improve code quality during maintenance, following the Boy Scout Ruleâ€”leave the code cleaner than you found it.
- **Avoid Switch Statements:** Prefer polymorphism to handle different behaviors.
- **Formatting:** Proper formatting increases readability; keep lines and functions short.

The book combines principles with detailed examples showing how to transform messy code into clean, manageable code, advocating professionalism and care in software craftsmanship to keep codebases sustainable and scalable.
